# FastAPI Blog Repository

Welcome to my FastAPI repository! In this series, I dive deep into FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python. This repo will guide you through various projects to master FastAPI and its numerous features.

## What is FastAPI?

FastAPI is a Python framework that simplifies the creation of APIs. With the increasing importance of APIs in the tech industry, big companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta offer their services through APIs. This approach allows them to provide access to their services without exposing their internal code or systems. Everyone can use these services via APIs.

### API Management Market Growth

According to recent reports, the API management market has been growing since 2022. As of 2024, it is valued at approximately 9 billion USD and is projected to reach 94 billion USD. This trend underscores the importance of learning API development, as it is a skill that will be highly beneficial in the near future.
